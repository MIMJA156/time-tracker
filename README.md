# VSCode Time Tracker

>NOTE: This is just a personal project. IT WILL NOT BE PERFECT!

## Features

This simply will track the amount of time you spend coding per day in vscode.
Allows you to view the data in a user friendly way by clicking on the time tracking badge.

# Install
Go to the [Vscode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MIMJA156.time-tracker-app) and download the extension, thats it!

## Rework in progress

There are a few things about the base extension code that are not very expandable. I am going to start a rework to improve the plugins adaptability.
